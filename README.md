# Receipt-Classification
Receipt Classification using Text Extraction in Python
This is a Machine learning Model to Classify receipt from the set of images.. It uses Pytesseract or Python-tesseract, an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool for python that can read and recognize text in images. I used wordninja to seperate the concatenated words from the extracted text in the form of a list. By comparing the presence of words such as tax, total, balance , etc we can conclude it is a receipt or not.
